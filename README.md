# Airbnb Data-Analysis

## Abstract:
<p align="justify">
Here the best technique for identifying the most excellent Airbnb accommodation in NYC based on price, availability, and other variables is determined. In-depth analysis of one of the country's and the world's most densely inhabited cities is conducted. As of November 2018, New York City was one of the top cities for Airbnb, with over 52,000 listings. Here real estate data for all Airbnb lodges in New York was used to analyze the rental landscape in New York City through different static and interactive visuals for our descriptive study. I tried different Data mining methods using R programming such as Linear regression, Regression trees, and the Boosting method approach to arrive at the best model for getting the most significant pricing for stays. It includes model specification, transformation, variable selection and more. Finally, I determined which model is the greatest fit for the customer's needs based on the lowest pricing for each model.

According to data, the most frequent form of Airbnb chosen is an “entire home/apartment”, followed by a “private room”. The least prevalent are “shared rooms”. Manhattan has the most Airbnb’s among the neighborhood groupings, followed by Brooklyn. The smallest is on Staten Island. It also reveals that the least price is 0, the average price is 152.7, and the highest price is 10,000, which is unusual, thus indicating probable outliers.
